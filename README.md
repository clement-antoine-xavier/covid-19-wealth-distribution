# COVID-19 and Wealth Distribution Analysis

A comprehensive econometric analysis examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on wealth distribution in the Euro Area, with a focus on Germany, France, and Slovenia.

## 🎯 Overview

This project combines distributional wealth accounts data from the European Central Bank with COVID-19 epidemiological data to analyze how the pandemic disrupted wealth accumulation trends and exacerbated inequality across different European economies.

## 🔬 Research Questions

1. **Pandemic Impact**: How has COVID-19 affected wealth distribution in Euro Area countries compared to pre-pandemic trends?
2. **Demographic Effects**: Which wealth segments (by percentile) experienced the most significant changes during the pandemic?
3. **Correlation Analysis**: How do COVID-19 infection rates and mortality correlate with changes in wealth inequality metrics?
4. **Predictive Deviation**: To what extent did actual wealth metrics deviate from pre-pandemic linear trend predictions?
5. **Cross-Country Comparison**: How do countries with different initial inequality levels (Germany, France, Slovenia) respond differently to the pandemic shock?

## 📊 Data Sources

### Wealth Distribution Data

- **Source**: [European Central Bank - Distributional Wealth Accounts](https://data.ecb.europa.eu/)
- **Coverage**: Quarterly data (2016-2025)
- **Metrics**:
  - Adjusted total assets and net wealth of households
  - Mean and median wealth distributions
  - Gini coefficients (inequality measure)
- **Countries**: Germany (DE), France (FR), Slovenia (LT)

### COVID-19 Epidemiological Data

- **Source**: [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/data)
- **Coverage**: Daily case and death counts
- **Aggregation**: Quarterly totals normalized per 100,000 population
- **Variables**: Total cases, deaths, population data (2020)

## 🔧 Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation

- **Temporal Alignment**: Aggregate daily COVID data to quarterly frequency to match wealth data
- **Normalization**: Calculate per-capita metrics (per 100,000 population) for cross-country comparison
- **Train-Test Split**:
  - Training: 2016-2019 (pre-pandemic baseline)
  - Testing: 2020-2025 (pandemic period)

### 2. Exploratory Analysis

- **Wealth Metrics Visualization**: Time series plots of 5 key indicators per country
- **COVID Timeline Analysis**: Cases and deaths trends across countries
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Distribution summaries and data quality checks

### 3. Predictive Modeling

- **Baseline Approach**: Linear regression using pre-pandemic trends (2016-2019)
- **Enhanced Models**:
  - **Polynomial Regression** (degree 2): Captures non-linear pre-pandemic trends
  - **Ridge Regression**: Regularized model to prevent overfitting
- **Purpose**: Establish counterfactual baseline to quantify pandemic disruption
- **Models**: Separate models for each country-metric-model combination
- **Model Comparison**: Side-by-side performance evaluation to identify best predictive approach
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
  - R² Score

### 4. Correlation Analysis

- **Pairwise Correlations**: Between COVID severity (cases/deaths) and wealth metrics
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps and color-coded tables
- **Interpretation**: Identify temporal relationships between pandemic waves and wealth changes

### 5. Integrated Visualization

- **Dual-Axis Plots**: Overlay wealth metrics with COVID severity timelines
- **Dashboard**: Comprehensive 5-panel summary of key findings
- **Comparison**: Cross-country patterns and divergent outcomes

## 📈 Key Findings

### Model Performance & Enhanced Predictions

- **Model Comparison Results**: Polynomial and Ridge regression models significantly outperform simple linear baseline
  - **Germany**: Polynomial models reduce average MAPE from 3.7% to 2.9%
  - **France**: Linear models perform well (2.4% MAPE) due to stable pre-pandemic trends
  - **Slovenia**: Polynomial models achieve up to 60% MAPE reduction (10.9% → 4.3%) for certain metrics
- **Best Model by Metric**:
  - Polynomial regression wins 8/15 metrics across countries
  - Linear regression: 6/15 metrics (particularly for France)
  - Ridge regression: 1/15 metrics
- **Key Insight**: Capturing non-linear pre-pandemic trends essential for accurate counterfactual predictions

### Prediction Accuracy & Pandemic Disruption

- **Pre-pandemic linear models**: Underestimated pandemic-era volatility for most metrics
- **Enhanced models improved accuracy**: Polynomial features capture acceleration/deceleration in wealth trends
- **Gini predictions most stable**: Inequality measures showed relatively smaller prediction errors, suggesting structural resilience

### COVID-19 Severity Comparison

- **Germany**: Highest absolute cases but moderate per-capita impact
- **France**: Severe outbreak with high deaths per 100k population
- **Slovenia**: Lower overall impact but concentrated waves

### Wealth Inequality Trends (Gini Coefficient)

- **Germany**: Slight increase in inequality (Gini change: +0.01 to +0.02 from 2020 Q1 to 2025 Q2)
- **France**: Moderate inequality resilience with minor fluctuations
- **Slovenia**: Relatively stable, confirming lower baseline inequality

### Correlation Patterns

- **Weak to moderate correlations** between COVID severity and wealth metrics (|r| < 0.5 in most cases)
- **Gini vs Deaths**: Mixed signals across countries, no consistent pattern
- **Mean Wealth vs Cases**: Slight positive correlations suggest asset price effects
- **Temporal lags**: Immediate COVID impact vs delayed wealth data reporting

### Research Implications

1. **Pandemic disrupted long-term wealth accumulation trends**: Pre-COVID models inadequate for crisis periods, but polynomial models capture non-linear dynamics better
2. **Wealth inequality showed resilience**: Structural factors outweighed short-term pandemic shocks
3. **Country-specific responses led to divergent outcomes**: Different policy approaches and economic structures matter
4. **Asset price effects dominate**: Financial asset valuations influenced wealth more than labor market disruptions
5. **Model selection matters**: Appropriate baseline model critical for measuring pandemic deviation from expected trends

## ⚠️ Limitations & Caveats

- **Correlation ≠ Causation**: Observed associations don't imply causal relationships
- **Timing Misalignment**: Wealth data reported quarterly with potential lags
- **Model Complexity**: While polynomial and ridge models improve accuracy, more sophisticated time series methods (ARIMA, VAR) may capture additional dynamics
- **Country Selection**: Analysis limited to 3 countries; not representative of entire Euro Area
- **Missing Variables**: No controls for fiscal policy, monetary interventions, or sector-specific effects
- **Measurement Issues**: Wealth accounts subject to revision and methodological changes
- **Sample Size**: Limited pre-pandemic training data (16 quarters) for complex models

## 🔮 Future Research Directions
