# COVID-19 - Wealth distribution

## Research Questions

This project aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on wealth distribution across different demographics and regions. The primary research questions include:

1. How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected wealth distribution globally and within specific countries?
2. What demographic groups have been most affected in terms of wealth inequality during the pandemic?
3. How do changes in wealth distribution correlate with COVID-19 infection rates and government response measures
4. What are the long-term implications of the pandemic on wealth inequality?
5. How effective have government interventions been in mitigating wealth disparities exacerbated by the pandemic?

## Data Sources

The analysis will utilize various data sources, including:

- [World Bank datasets on global wealth distribution](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/wealth-accounts)
- [COVID-19 infection and mortality rates from the World Health Organization (WHO)](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/data)
- [Government policy response data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/publications/variation-government-responses-covid-19)

## Methodology

The project will employ a combination of statistical analysis, econometric modeling, and data visualization techniques to address the research questions. Key steps include:

1. Data Collection: Gather relevant datasets from the identified sources.
2. Data Cleaning: Preprocess the data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.
3. Descriptive Analysis: Conduct initial exploratory data analysis to understand trends and patterns.
4. Econometric Modeling: Use regression analysis and other econometric techniques to assess the impact of COVID-19 on wealth distribution.
5. Visualization: Create visual representations of the findings to facilitate interpretation and communication of results.
6. Interpretation: Analyze the results in the context of existing literature and theories on wealth inequality.

## Expected Outcomes

The project aims to provide insights into how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced wealth distribution globally and within specific demographics. Expected outcomes include:

- A comprehensive report detailing the findings and implications of the analysis.
- Visualizations illustrating changes in wealth distribution during the pandemic.
- Policy recommendations for addressing wealth inequality exacerbated by the pandemic.
- Identification of demographic groups most affected by wealth disparities during the pandemic.
- Suggestions for future research directions in the field of wealth distribution and economic resilience in the face of
global crises.
